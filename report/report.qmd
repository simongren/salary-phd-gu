**Fully AI-generated.** This report and all visualisations were generated by GitHub Copilot (Claude Sonnet 4.5) based on the official negotiated salary agreements published by Göteborgs Universitet. No manual analysis has been performed. The purpose is purely to share structured information about how PhD salaries have developed over time.
:::

## Background

Each autumn, PhD salaries at Göteborgs Universitet (GU) are renegotiated locally at the faculty level. The agreements set four salary steps tied to the share of completed PhD requirements:

| Step | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **0 %** | Entry level — newly admitted |
| **50 %** | Mid-way through doctoral studies |
| **80 %** | Near completion |
| **100 %** | Post-defence / doctoral degree awarded |

This report covers the salary agreements effective 1 October in 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, across the following faculty groupings:

- **Sahlgrenska Akademin** — 6 groups (medical basescience, with/without medical degree, licensed physicians, etc.)
- **Naturvetenskapliga fakulteten / IT-fakulteten** — merged into one faculty from 2025; 2–3 groups
- **Konstnärliga / Humanistiska / Samhällsvetenskapliga fakulteterna / Handelshögskolan** — 2 groups (Juridik and Övriga)
- **Utbildningsvetenskapliga fakulteten** — 1 group

The dataset covers **48 observations** (12 groups × 4 years).

## Graph 1 — Salary at 80% completion across all groups, 2022–2025

![Absolute monthly salary (SEK) at 80% completion per PhD group, by faculty. Shared y-axis so levels are directly comparable across panels.](../output/01_overview_80pct.png)

This chart shows the **absolute monthly salary (SEK)** at the 80% completion step for every PhD group at GU, broken out by faculty. Each line is one PhD group; labels on the right identify the group at 2025.

The shared y-axis means the **level** of salaries is directly comparable across faculty panels — Sahlgrenska's medical groups cluster at the top of the range, while humanities/social sciences and education faculties sit at the bottom.

## Graph 2 — Indexed salary vs. KPI inflation (all groups, 80% level)

![All salaries re-indexed to 2022 = 100. The dashed red line is cumulative Swedish KPI (Consumer Price Index), measured October-to-October. Lines above the red line indicate salary growth outpacing inflation.](../output/04_index_80pct_vs_cpif.png)

All salaries are **re-expressed as an index where 2022 = 100**, making growth rates comparable across groups regardless of starting salary level. The dashed red line is the cumulative Swedish **KPI** (Konsumentprisindex / Consumer Price Index), measured October-to-October to match the timing of the salary negotiations. Source: SCB skuggindex.

| Period | Annual KPI change | Cumulative from Oct 2022 |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Oct 2023 | +6.5 % | 106.5 |
| Oct 2024 | +1.6 % | 108.2 |
| Oct 2025 | +0.9 % | 109.2 |

Lines **above** the red dashed line indicate salary growth that outpaced inflation; lines **below** indicate real-terms erosion.

## Graph 3 — Spotlight: Övriga doktorander, Humanities / Social Sciences

![Four panels (one per salary step). Blue = Övriga doktorander (Hum/Soc). Grey = all other PhD groups at GU. Red dashed = KPI. Index value at 2025 is printed on the blue line.](../output/06_spotlight_ovriga_hum_socsci.png)

This chart focuses on **"Övriga doktorander"** within the joint faculty of Konstnärliga / Humanistiska / Samhällsvetenskapliga fakulteterna / Handelshögskolan — the largest catch-all PhD group for humanities, social sciences, arts and business. The four panels correspond to the four salary steps.

- **Blue line** — Övriga doktorander (Hum/Soc/Arts/Business)
- **Light grey lines** — all other PhD groups at GU, for context
- **Red dashed line** — KPI inflation

The index value printed at 2025 shows the cumulative salary growth from the 2022 base for that step.

Salary values for this group:

| Year | 0 % | 50 % | 80 % | 100 % |
|------|-----|------|------|-------|
| 2022 | 28 675 kr | 30 950 kr | 33 400 kr | 35 000 kr |
| 2023 | 30 100 kr | 32 100 kr | 34 600 kr | 34 600 kr |
| 2024 | 31 200 kr | 33 100 kr | 35 600 kr | 35 600 kr |
| 2025 | 32 300 kr | 34 200 kr | 36 800 kr | 36 800 kr |
| **Change 2022–2025** | **+12.6 %** | **+10.5 %** | **+10.2 %** | **+5.1 %** |

Cumulative KPI (Oct 2022 – Oct 2025): **+9.2 %**

## Data & Code

All source PDFs, the extracted dataset (`data/salaries.csv`) and the R visualisation script (`R/plot_salaries.R`) are openly available at:

**[github.com/simongren/salary-phd-gu](https://github.com/simongren/salary-phd-gu)**

Data was extracted from the official PDF attachments (*Bilaga 1*) to the locally negotiated salary agreements (*Lokalt avtal om lönessättningsprinciper för doktorander*, Dnr P 2016/121 and subsequent years). The 2025 agreement PDF was image-based and required OCR processing (Tesseract, Swedish language model).

KPI data: Statistics Sweden (SCB), skuggindex, October values.
